# sharpdsp
SharpDSP is an open source .NET digital signal processing library written by David Newell.

The project aims to provide a useful set of DSP tools written in pure and easily readable C#. Zero opaque 'magic' code will be tolerated, so it may also help clarify DSP fundementals for those new to the field.

NOTE: This is currently a pre-alpha WIP, only currently useful as a learning tool if at all. Work has resumed however, and a functional alpha release should be made soon.

A big thank you to Mark Heath for his excellent NAudio libraries, which are used for basic format conversion and I/O.

Thanks for the interest, and Stay tuned!
